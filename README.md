# Digital
This is an Informative blog on new concepts & terms related to Digital that involves Digital Twin, AI, Robotics, Data Engineering, IOT, Virtual reality <br>


Digital Twin<br>
*************<br>

A digital twin is a digital or virtual copy of physical assets or products. The term digital twin was coined originally by Dr. Michael Grieves in 2002.
Nasa was one of the first to use this technology for space exploration missions.  Digital Twin connect the real and virtual world by collecting real -time data 
from the installed sensors. The collected data is either locally decentralized or centrally stored in a cloud. The data is then evaluated and simulated in virtual 
copy of the assets.After receiving the information from the simulation, the parameters are applied to real assets.This integration of data in real and virtual representations helps in optimizing the performance of real assets. Digital twins can be used in various industries:MANUFACTURING, AUTOMOTIVE,CONSTRUCTION, UTILITIES, HEALTH CARE. <br><br>
Digital Twins are the next big thing in Fourth Industrial Revolution for the development of new products and processes.


AWS CONTROL TOWER<br>
********************<br>
The easiest way to set up and govern a secure multi-account AWS environment<br>

If you have multiple AWS accounts and teams, cloud setup and governance can be complex and time consuming, slowing down the very innovation you’re trying to speed up. AWS Control Tower provides the easiest way to set up and govern a secure, multi-account AWS environment, called a landing zone. It creates your landing zone using AWS Organizations, bringing ongoing account management and governance as well as implementation best practices based on AWS’s experience working with thousands of customers as they move to the cloud. Builders can provision new AWS accounts in a few clicks, while you have peace of mind knowing that your accounts conform to company policies. Extend governance into new or existing accounts, and gain visibility into their compliance status quickly. If you are building a new AWS environment, starting out on your journey to AWS, or starting a new cloud initiative, AWS Control Tower will help you get started quickly with built-in governance and best practices. <br>

AWS IoT TwinMaker<br>
**********************<br>
Optimize operations by easily creating digital twins of real-world systems<br>

AWS IoT TwinMaker makes it easier for developers to create digital twins of real-world systems such as buildings, factories, industrial equipment, and production lines. AWS IoT TwinMaker provides the tools you need to build digital twins to help you optimize building operations, increase production output, and improve equipment performance. With the ability to use existing data from multiple sources, create virtual representations of any physical environment, and combine existing 3D models with real-world data, you can now harness digital twins to create a holistic view of your operations faster and with less effort.

Amazon SageMaker<br>
*********************<br>
Build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models for any use case with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows

Make ML predictions using a visual interface with SageMaker Canvas.
Prepare data and build, train, and deploy models with SageMaker Studio.
Deploy and manage models at scale with SageMaker MLOps.

Make ML more accessible
Enable more people to innovate with ML through a choice of tools—integrated development environments for data scientists and no-code visual interfaces for business analysts.

Prepare data at scale
Access, label, and process large amounts of structured data (tabular data) and unstructured data (photos, video, and audio) for ML.

Accelerate ML development
Reduce training time from hours to minutes with optimized infrastructure. Boost team productivity up to 10 times with purpose-built tools.

Streamline the ML lifecycle
Automate and standardize MLOps practices across your organization to build, train, deploy, and manage models at scale.
