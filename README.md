Digital Twin<br>
*************<br>

A digital twin is a digital or virtual copy of physical assets or products. The term digital twin was coined originally by Dr. Michael Grieves in 2002.
Nasa was one of the first to use this technology for space exploration missions.  Digital Twin connect the real and virtual world by collecting real -time data 
from the installed sensors. The collected data is either locally decentralized or centrally stored in a cloud. The data is then evaluated and simulated in virtual 
copy of the assets.After receiving the information from the simulation, the parameters are applied to real assets.This integration of data in real and virtual representations helps in optimizing the performance of real assets. Digital twins can be used in various industries:MANUFACTURING, AUTOMOTIVE,CONSTRUCTION, UTILITIES, HEALTH CARE. <br><br>
Digital Twins are the next big thing in Fourth Industrial Revolution for the development of new products and processes.
