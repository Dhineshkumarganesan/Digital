# Digital
This is an Informative blog on new concepts & terms related to Digital that involves Digital Twin, AI, Robotics, Data Engineering, IOT, Virtual reality on AWS Cloud Platform <br>

**********************************<br>
Digital Twin<br>
**********************************<br>

A digital twin is a digital or virtual copy of physical assets or products. The term digital twin was coined originally by Dr. Michael Grieves in 2002.
Nasa was one of the first to use this technology for space exploration missions.  Digital Twin connect the real and virtual world by collecting real -time data 
from the installed sensors. The collected data is either locally decentralized or centrally stored in a cloud. The data is then evaluated and simulated in virtual 
copy of the assets.After receiving the information from the simulation, the parameters are applied to real assets.This integration of data in real and virtual representations helps in optimizing the performance of real assets. Digital twins can be used in various industries:MANUFACTURING, AUTOMOTIVE,CONSTRUCTION, UTILITIES, HEALTH CARE. <br><br>
Digital Twins are the next big thing in Fourth Industrial Revolution for the development of new products and processes.

**********************************<br>
Curation of Data <br>
**********************************<br>

Data curation is the process of creating, organizing and maintaining data sets so they can be accessed and used by people looking for information. It involves collecting, structuring, indexing and cataloging data for users in an organization, group or the general public. Main reason to learn data curation is to improve communication about data on your team.

Data curation files consists of Flowcharts, tables other than data tables, Diagrams, Cheat sheets, Manuals, Data dictionaries,Survery documentation, Warehouse documentation, Policies and Procedures.

A data reduction diagram is a flow chart that shows how you systematically removed records from bigger datasets to reduce it to a smaller dataset.

Good Data --> Good ML Model

Awesome Data --> Awesome ML Model

Best Practices to perfom data curation 

1.Clear Labels
2.Relevant data
3.Beware of biased data 
a)Collect more data
b)Adjust weighting
4.Use consistent terms
5.Rule out - data leakage

Amazon S3

Amazon S3 or Amazon Simple Storage Service is a service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface. Amazon S3 uses the same scalable storage infrastructure that Amazon.com uses to run its e-commerce network

Amazon EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster.

Amazon ECR

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is an AWS managed container image registry service that is secure, scalable, and reliable. Amazon ECR supports private repositories with resource-based permissions using AWS IAM.

Amazon SQS

What is Amazon SQS used for?
Amazon SQS is a message queue service used by distributed applications to exchange messages through a polling model, and can be used to decouple sending and receiving components.

Amazon SNS

What is an Amazon SNS topic?
An Amazon SNS topic is a logical access point that acts as a communication channel. A topic lets you group multiple endpoints (such as AWS Lambda, Amazon SQS, HTTP/S, or an email address).

**********************************<br>

AI ML Curation

What is Data Curation? 
As defined by tech republic, data curation is “the art of maintaining the value of data.” It is the process of collecting, organizing, labeling, cleaning, enhancing and preserving data for use

What is AI curation?
AI-based curation refers to the use of algorithms to process huge volumes of data, deciphering meaning and patterns. AI works by analysing user data to make sense of user intent, thereby helping marketers address consumers better

ML Pipeline

One definition of an ML pipeline is a means of automating the machine learning workflow by enabling data to be transformed and correlated into a model that can then be analyzed to achieve outputs. This type of ML pipeline makes the process of inputting data into the ML model fully automated.

************************************<br>
Ontology <br>
************************************<br>

In metaphysics, ontology is the philosophical study of being, as well as related concepts such as existence, becoming, and reality. Ontology addresses questions of how entities are grouped into categories and which of these entities exist on the most fundamental level.

In computer science and information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse. More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.

Databases utilize entity-relationship diagrams, which represent the logic of the database, whereas ontologies are expressed in languages with which you can describe logics.

The fundamental focus of an ontology is to specify and share meaning. The fundamental focus for a database schema is to describe data. A relational database schema has a single purpose: to structure a set of instances for efficient storage and querying.

What is a database ontology?<br>

An ontology database is a basic relational database management system that models an ontology plus its instances. To reason over the transitive closure of instances in the subsumption hierarchy, for example, an ontology database can either unfold views at query time or propagate assertions using triggers at load time.

GRPC

gRPC is a cross-platform open source high performance Remote Procedure Call framework. gRPC was initially created by Google, which has used a single general-purpose RPC infrastructure called Stubby to connect the large number of microservices running within and across its data centers for over a decade.

why SQS

Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available. Get started with SQS in minutes using the AWS Management Console, Command Line Interface or SDK of your choice, and three simple commands.
