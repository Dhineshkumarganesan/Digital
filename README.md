Digital Twin<br>
*************<br>

A digital twin is a digital or virtual copy of physical assets or products. The term digital twin was coined originally by Dr. Michael Grieves in 2002.
Nasa was one of the first to use this technology for space exploration missions.  Digital Twin connect the real and virtual world by collecting real -time data 
from the installed sensors. The collected data is either locally decentralized or centrally stored in a cloud. The data is then evaluated and simulated in virtual 
copy of the assets.After receiving the information from the simulation, the parameters are applied to real assets.This integration of data in real and virtual representations helps in optimizing the performance of real assets. Digital twins can be used in various industries:MANUFACTURING, AUTOMOTIVE,CONSTRUCTION, UTILITIES, HEALTH CARE. <br><br>
Digital Twins are the next big thing in Fourth Industrial Revolution for the development of new products and processes.


AWS CONTROL TOWER<br>
*****************<br>

If you have multiple AWS accounts and teams, cloud setup and governance can be complex and time consuming, slowing down the very innovation you’re trying to speed up. AWS Control Tower provides the easiest way to set up and govern a secure, multi-account AWS environment, called a landing zone. It creates your landing zone using AWS Organizations, bringing ongoing account management and governance as well as implementation best practices based on AWS’s experience working with thousands of customers as they move to the cloud. Builders can provision new AWS accounts in a few clicks, while you have peace of mind knowing that your accounts conform to company policies. Extend governance into new or existing accounts, and gain visibility into their compliance status quickly.
